##  Usage Guide

### Android App Workflow

1. **Accept Legal Consent**
   - First launch shows legal notice
   - Confirm you have permission to monitor traffic

2. **Start Capture**
   - Tap the Play button (top-right)
   - Grant VPN permission when prompted
   - Capture starts immediately

3. **Apply Filters**
   - Use quick filter chips to focus on specific traffic
   - View real-time dashboard metrics

4. **Review Alerts**
   - Check notification badge for security alerts
   - Tap to view details and evidence

5. **Export Data**
   - Navigate to Export screen
   - Choose PCAP, JSON, or Evidence Bundle
   - Share with desktop app

---

##  Security & Privacy

### Legal Compliance
- **Consent Enforcement**: Mandatory legal notice on first launch
- **Audit Logging**: All capture sessions logged with timestamps
- **Auto-Cleanup**: Configurable data retention (default: 24 hours)

### Data Protection
- **Encrypted Exports**: AES-256-GCM using Android Keystore
- **Ephemeral Mode**: Optional no-disk-write mode
- **Local Processing**: All analysis happens on-device

### Ethical Use
This tool is intended for:
-  Authorized security professionals
-  Network administrators
-  Security researchers (with proper authorization)
-  Educational purposes (in controlled environments)

**Unauthorized network monitoring is illegal in most jurisdictions.**

##  Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: HTTP Traffic Analysis
```
1. Start capture
2. Apply "HTTP/HTTPS" filter
3. Visit http://example.com
4. Review GET requests in packet list
5. Export as PCAP for Wireshark analysis
```

### Scenario 2: DNS Query Inspection
```
1. Start capture
2. Apply "DNS" filter  
3. Perform web browsing
4. Check DNS queries to various domains
5. Detect any suspicious DNS patterns
```

### Scenario 3: Data Exfiltration Detection
```
1. Start capture
2. Simulate large file upload (>1MB in 10s)
3. Alert triggers automatically
4. Export evidence bundle
5. Import to desktop for timeline replay
```

---

##  Performance

### Android App
- **CPU Usage**: <5% average during capture
- **Memory**: ~50MB RAM footprint
- **Battery**: <2% per hour (background capture)
- **Packet Rate**: Up to 5,000 packets/sec

---

##  Troubleshooting

### Android

**Issue**: VPN permission denied
- **Solution**: Go to Settings → Apps → Packet Hunter → Permissions → Grant VPN access

**Issue**: No packets captured
- **Solution**: Ensure you're generating network traffic (browse web, use apps)

**Issue**: App crashes on start
- **Solution**: Check Android version (need 8.0+), clear app data
